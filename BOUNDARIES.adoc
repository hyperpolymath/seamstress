= Boundaries (What this project is NOT)

* Not a full enterprise architecture modeling platform.
* Not a perfect static analysis suite.
* Not an auto-refactoring framework.
* Not language-specific: seam artifacts are canonical and language-neutral.

The core (`seamctl`) remains strict, deterministic, and small.
