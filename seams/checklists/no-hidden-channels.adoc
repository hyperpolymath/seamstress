= No Hidden Channels Checklist

This checklist is completed per seam.

* Are there undocumented dependencies (global state, env vars, implicit ordering)?
* Are logs being parsed as an API?
* Are there side channels (timing, error messages, shared caches) that matter?
* Is the least-privilege capability set explicit?
