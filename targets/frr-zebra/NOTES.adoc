= FRR Zebra proving ground

This target exists to exercise one seam slice end-to-end.

== Focus seam slice (v0)
* Zebra ↔ zserv (IPC boundary between zebra and other daemons)

The goal is not to model all of FRR; it is to force the seam artifact model,
validation, reporting, and later conformance vectors to be real.
