== Core vs orchestration

* `tools/seamctl` (Rust) is the authoritative seam truth engine.
* `services/seamstressd` (Elixir) orchestrates checks and automations; it must not redefine seam semantics.

== Canonical artifacts

* `seams/schema/` — schema for seam records
* `seams/records/` — seam records for this repo
* `targets/**/seams/records/` — seam records for proving grounds and integrations
